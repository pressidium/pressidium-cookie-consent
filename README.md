Easily modify the cookie consent banner and settings modal text. Pick one of the built-in color presets to match your website’s aesthetic, or adjust the color of individual components via our convenient color picker. Choose from a variety of layouts, positions, and transitions directly from the WordPress dashboard.

### 🪶 Lightweight

The plugin is built on top of the Cookie Consent JS library by Orest Bida, a standalone vanilla JavaScript library with no third-party dependencies, that loads blazingly fast and won’t slow down your website.

### ♿ Accessible

An a11y friendly plugin — fully accessible and WAI-ARIA compliant.

### 🌐 Translatable

![Translations tab screenshot](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-4.png)

Modify any text in the cookie consent banner and settings modal, and provide translations. Choose the language auto-detection strategy you prefer — either  read the user’s browser language or read the markup of the current page to identify its primary language.

### 📱 Responsive

Fully responsive and mobile-friendly cookie consent banner and settings modal.

### 🙅 Block scripts

![Blocked scripts tab screenshot](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-10.png)

Control which scripts are loaded based on the user’s preferences. List the URLs of the scripts you’d like to block (both exact matches and regular expressions are supported) and prevent them from running until the user has given consent.

### 🧹 Auto-clear cookies

### ✋ Force consent

Add a floating settings button to your website that allows users to change their cookie preferences at any time.

### 🧩 Google Consent Mode (GCM) integration

### 🧱 Block for the WordPress Block Editor

![Pressidium Cookies Table block screenshot](./.wordpress-org/screenshot-12.png)

Add the **Pressidium Cookies Table** block for the Block Editor to display a dynamic table listing all cookies under the selected category, making it easy for users to understand what cookies are being used on the site.

### ⌨️ Control it programmatically

Programmatically control the plugin. Conditionally show/hide the cookie consent banner and/or the settings modal, accept one (or more) cookie categories, erase cookies, load previously blocked scripts, etc.
