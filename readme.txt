Lightweight, user-friendly and customizable cookie consent banner to help you comply with the EU GDPR cookie law and CCPA regulations.

== Description ==

Pressidium Cookie Consent makes it easy to add a stylish, customizable cookie consent banner to your website and conditionally load third-party scripts (analytics, performance, targeting, etc.) based on the user-selected preferences to help you comply with EU GDPR cookie law, CCPA, and similar regulations.

= ⚙️ Fully customizable =

Easily modify the cookie consent banner and settings modal text. Pick one of the built-in color presets to match your website’s aesthetic, or adjust the color of individual components via our convenient color picker. Choose from a variety of layouts, positions, and transitions directly from the WordPress dashboard.

= 🪶 Lightweight =

The plugin is built on top of the Cookie Consent JS library by Orest Bida, a standalone vanilla JavaScript library with no third-party dependencies, that loads blazingly fast and won’t slow down your website.

= ♿ Accessible =

An a11y friendly plugin — fully accessible and WAI-ARIA compliant.

= 🌐 Translatable =

Modify any text in the cookie consent banner and settings modal, and provide translations. Choose the language auto-detection strategy you prefer — either  read the user’s browser language or read the markup of the current page to identify its primary language.

= 📱 Responsive =

Fully responsive and mobile-friendly cookie consent banner and settings modal.

= 🙅 Block scripts =

Control which scripts are loaded based on the user’s preferences. List the URLs of the scripts you’d like to block (both exact matches and regular expressions are supported) and prevent them from running until the user has given consent.

= 🧹 Auto-clear cookies =

Automatically delete cookies when a user opts-out of a specific category inside cookie settings.

= ✋ Force consent =

Block the user from interacting with the page until they consent to your cookie policy.

= 🔁 Re-consent =

Ask users to consent again when you update your cookie policy.

= 🤖 Hide from bots =

Automatically parse the user agent to detect bots, crawlers, and webdrivers. If one is detected, you have the option to hide the cookie consent banner from them.

= ⌨️ Control it programmatically =

Programmatically control the plugin. Conditionally show/hide the cookie consent banner and/or the settings modal, accept one (or more) cookie categories, erase cookies, load previously blocked scripts, etc.
